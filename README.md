# Caesar Cipher Tool

This project is a simple Python-based Caesar Cipher tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a classic substitution cipher technique. It serves as a learning resource for basic cryptography and Python programming fundamentals.

## Features

- Encrypt plaintext messages using Caesar Cipher logic
- Decrypt messages with a known shift key
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase characters
- Preserves spaces, punctuation, and non-alphabetical symbols
- User-friendly command-line interface

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of `3`, the letter `A` becomes `D`, `B` becomes `E`, and so on. Decryption shifts letters in the opposite direction.
